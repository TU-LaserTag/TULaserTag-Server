                    Laser tag has been a popular game for decades, as it provides an ability to run around shooting people without injuring them. It also uses bright colors and sounds, attracting the skeptical adults. Now, however, Taylor University is taking it to the next level. To do so, they enslaved several poor, innocent, computer science college students into a required class so intense that it made every one of them rethink their major choice. Teaming up with them was a physics group, building the hardware for the game. However, this game was to be like no other. Instead of specialized blasters that only worked in certain areas with certain people and in a certain room, Taylor decided they wanted to make the game mobile. Therefore, they decided to create blasters out of old nerf guns, enabling anyone to play the game with ease. Additionally, the game was made to be played anywhere and everywhere, enabling games to begin on interstates, as people in cars took shots at each other from across the road. This revolutionized the laser tag game, as it became a household item used commonly throughout the world. This caused grief to millions of parents, as their children put down their phones and picked up a blaster that shot light at people.

                    In addition to the basic premise of the game, Taylor also decided they wanted a mobile app for it and a web app, which they assigned several of the same, overworked, exhausted students to achieve. Together, they created something that could only rise out of the ashes of lost sleep: the game you now have stumbled upon today. Laser tag has been reinvented, and the world is not ready. The revolutionary tactics and ideas that can be designed with this new game can go anywhere, as the playing field is only as big as the cornfields surrounding Taylor, or wherever the server is hosted. The fact that the game is mobile and on an app means the possiblities of playing are endless, as long as the server and databse do not collapse. Taylor University is not held liable for any damages this game may cause during the entertaining action. Please wear eye protection, as the lack of it may decrease your health when looking into a laser. Side effects may include joy, laughter, pain, heartbreak, and action. Use responsibly. Do not actually play and drive at the same time; make sure you have a self-driving car first. You must be born to be able to play, although we recommend being able to hold a gun first. Remember to follow the LTC at all times, and never forget to have fun.
